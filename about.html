      <p class="statspara">40 million Americans, 12 million American children, and 15 million American families suffer from food insecurity every day. This means that many people have a lack of access to food so they can feed their families. In America, hunger is a result of poverty and financial resources. We believe it's time to end this crisis. We have the resources to end hunger in America - will you join us?</p>
